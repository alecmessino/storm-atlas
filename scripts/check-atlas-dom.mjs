/* Does the Storm Atlas's honesty surface reach the SCREEN?
 *
 * Every other Atlas check asserts something about a value: the pack matches the archive, the
 * browser's engine matches the Python. This one asserts something about the pixels -- that the
 * denominators, the refusals, the withheld class, the derived flags and the gaps actually
 * render, in text a reader can see. A rule that only lives in source is a rule nobody enforced,
 * and this surface's entire job is to not undo the archive's refusal discipline on the way to a
 * pixel. It is the same argument as scripts/check-panel-dom.mjs, applied to the second surface.
 *
 * IT DRIVES THE UI INTO EACH STATE RATHER THAN SUBSTITUTING A FIXTURE. check-panel-dom.mjs has
 * to swap in an edge-case payload because the live one rarely contains a refusal. The Atlas
 * holds the whole archive, so every honest state is reachable from the real data by clicking:
 * an ocean point where nothing forms, a storm whose intensity was never recorded, a landfall
 * whose class the archive withheld. Exercising the real paths is strictly stronger than
 * exercising a fixture that resembles them.
 *
 * NOT IN CI, for the same reason check-panel-dom.mjs is not: it needs a browser binary.
 *   npm i --no-save playwright && npx playwright install chromium

   * over exactly the case it exists to check.

   * The PROPERTY is unchanged and the detection is now stronger: a row that refuses is one

 *   bridge ever read the cursor, the `w=` it writes would follow the track -- so the check is
 *   an equality against the archive's own genesis column, with the cursor position proved to be
 *   a different place.
 *
 *   IT DOES NOT QUIETLY DROP THE READER'S OTHER CONDITIONS. A bridge that replaced the whole
 *   spec rather than its location would answer a different question under the same heading.
 *
 *   THE STORM STAYS IN ITS OWN COHORT AND THE PANEL SAYS SO. "1 of N", and where the evidence
 *   is thin, which numerator it is inside. A regression here reads as a rate ABOUT the storm.
 *
 *   AND THE HAND-OFF KEEPS THE COHORT WHILE PUTTING THE STORM DOWN. The button promises exactly
 *   that; nothing else on the surface checks that it happens.
 *
 * Everything is addressed by data hook, never by label -- see Chip and TextButton in kit.jsx. */
