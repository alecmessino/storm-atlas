/* ATCF deck parsers — a-deck (guidance), b-deck (best track), f-deck (fixes).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every number on this board used to arrive after NHC had already
 * written it into a public advisory, which is the same moment the public reads it. The
 * decks are the layer underneath: the aids land in the a-deck as soon as the models
 * finish, typically 30-60 minutes before the advisory built from them is issued. That
 * window is the only structural head-start this pipeline can have, and it is why the
 * a-deck is priority one.
 *
 * These are PURE parsers — no network, no clock. Everything that fetches lives in
 * scripts/ingest.mjs, so the formats can be tested against committed fixtures.
 *
 * FORMAT, ESTABLISHED BY EVIDENCE rather than from memory. Every field index below was
 * read off a live deck (acp012026 / fcp012026, 14 Aug 2026) before it was written down:
 *
 *   a-deck  CP, 01, 2026081418, 03, HCCA, 132, 236N, 1732W, 113, 0, , 0, , 0,0,0,0
 *           0    1   2           3   4     5    6     7      8   9  10 11 12 13..16
 *           basin cy  cycle    technum tech tau  lat  lon   vmax mslp ty rad code radii
 *
 *   f-deck  CP, 01, 202608140921, 31, OSCT, CI, , 1652N, 14868W, , 3, 40, 3, , 3, ...
 *           0    1   2             3   4     5   6  7      8      9 10  11  12 13 14
 *           basin cy  time      format type ci flag lat  lon  height posC vmax vC pres pC
 *
 * TWO TRAPS THE LIVE DATA CONTAINS, both handled here rather than downstream:
 *
 *  1. A ZERO IS A MISSING VALUE, NOT A FORECAST. TVCN — the track consensus — ships
 *     vmax=0 on every row, because it is a TRACK aid and has no intensity to give.
 *     Reading that as "the consensus forecasts 0 kt" would drag every blend it touches
 *     to nothing. Zero vmax and zero mslp are nulled here, at the parse boundary.
 *  2. ONE FORECAST APPEARS ON SEVERAL ROWS. Each wind-radius threshold (34/50/64 kt)
 *     repeats the whole record, so a naive read counts one aid three times and a
 *     "member spread" computed over it is spuriously tight. Rows are keyed on
 *     (tech, tau) and merged.
