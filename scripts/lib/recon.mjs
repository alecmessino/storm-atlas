/* Aircraft reconnaissance — the Vortex Data Message (VDM).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS THE VOLATILITY CATALYST. Every other intensity number on this board is an
 * estimate: satellite pattern-matching, a model, or a forecaster's judgement over those.
 * A VDM is a MEASUREMENT — an aircraft flew through the middle of the storm and read the
 * pressure off an instrument. When a plane finds a central pressure 12 mb lower than the
 * last advisory carried, the advisory that follows will move, and the public has not seen
 * it yet.
 *
 * The message is transmitted the moment the aircraft leaves the eye, typically an hour or
 * more before the intermediate advisory built on it. Nothing else this pipeline reads has
 * that lead.
 *
 * PURE PARSER — no network, no clock. scripts/ingest.mjs does the polling.
 *
 * FORMAT, ESTABLISHED BY EVIDENCE. The lettered fields below were read off two live
 * products (URPN12 KNHC for CP012026, URNT12 KNHC for AL022026) rather than recalled:
 *
 *   URPN12 KNHC 142104
 *   VORTEX DATA MESSAGE   CP012026
 *   A. 14/20:46:50Z                    time of the center fix
 *   B. 17.33 deg N 151.19 deg W        center
 *   C. 700 mb 3077 m                   flight level
 *   D. 999 mb                          minimum sea-level pressure ("EXTRAP 1004 mb" when
 *                                      extrapolated rather than measured)
 *   H. 45 kt                           maximum surface wind, inbound leg
 *   J. 090 deg 51 kt                   maximum flight-level wind, inbound leg
 *   L. 29 kt                           maximum surface wind, outbound leg
 *   N. 252 deg 27 kt                   maximum flight-level wind, outbound leg
 *   U. AF305 0701C LALA    OB 04       mission, storm, observation number
 *   MAX FL WIND 51 KT 349 / 95 NM 20:19:00Z
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PARSED. Fields E, F and G differ between the two live samples
 * and this build cannot state what they are, so they are captured verbatim and given no
 * meaning. Reading a number out of a field whose definition is a guess is exactly the
 * failure this file is supposed to prevent — a wrong wind speed looks identical to a
 * right one. The same rule kills the RECCO-coded URNT11/URPN11 products: their arrival is
 * recorded, their numbers are not decoded.
 *
 * SELF-CHECKING. The trailer line states the maximum flight-level wind in plain words.
 * When it disagrees with the lettered field, BOTH are published and the trailer governs,
 * because it is the unambiguous one. A silent disagreement would mean the letters have
 * shifted under us, so the disagreement is reported rather than resolved away.

 * multiplied by 0.90 to estimate the surface wind, an 850 mb wind by 0.80.
 *
 * Two levels, and nothing between them. A storm flown at 600 mb gets no calibrated
 * surface wind from this file at all — interpolating a factor nobody published would be
