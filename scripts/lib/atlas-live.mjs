/* atlas-live-v1 — the operational selected-storm artifact the Storm Atlas reads.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The Storm Atlas packs are pure IBTrACS. IBTrACS publishes a PROVISIONAL
 * record for the current season and stops updating it long before the storm stops existing, so
 * a storm that is still being flown reaches the Atlas as a finished, shorter, weaker storm.
 * Measured on the shipped pack: CP012026 / LALA is 65 kt, Category 1, 988 mb, 49 fixes, ending
 * 2026-08-16T00:00Z. The ATCF b-deck the ingest ALREADY FETCHES on the same tick carries 63
 * fixes reaching 2026-08-25T12:00Z, a peak of 115 kt and a minimum of 947 mb. Nothing was
 * missing from the pipeline; the two halves were never joined.
 *
 * They are not joined here either, and that is the design. This file writes a SECOND, tiny
 * artifact beside the packs, keyed by ATCF id. The Atlas loads it separately, uses it as the
 * OPERATIONAL representation of a selected current storm, and never lets a value from it reach
 * the archive: no cohort, no analog, no rate, no interval, no calibration, no refusal. IBTrACS
 * remains the archive. ATCF becomes the operational selected-storm view. See
 * docs/storm-atlas/ATLAS-LIVE.md for the precedence rule in full.
 *
 * PURE. No network and no clock — `nowMs` and the parsed decks are arguments, so the whole
 * artifact can be built from a committed fixture and asserted byte for byte. Everything that
 * fetches lives in scripts/ingest.mjs, exactly as the deck parsers do.
 *
 * TWO TIMESTAMPS, NEVER ONE. `latest_valid_time` is when the SOURCE says the storm was where it
 * says it was. `fetched_at` is when this pipeline read the file. A single "cycle" field
 * collapsing the two is how a nine-day-old record comes to look like a fresh one, so the two are
 * separate everywhere in this schema and the age between them is published rather than implied.

 * WHY RETENTION IS NOT OPTIONAL. The active list is NHC's CurrentStorms.json, and a storm leaves

 * months. Without retention the Atlas would show operational truth for exactly as long as the
 * storm was on the news and then silently revert to the 49-fix archive stub the day it
 * dissipated — reintroducing the identical failure at the identical place. A retained record is
 * NOT re-polled; it is the last operational record observed, and it carries the age that says so.
