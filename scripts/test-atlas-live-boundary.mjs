/* THE WALL BETWEEN THE OPERATIONAL LAYER AND THE HISTORICAL RESEARCH.
 *
 * The Atlas now shows two records for a current storm: the IBTrACS archive, and the ATCF
 * operational best track. The second is a SELECTED-STORM REPRESENTATION LAYER and nothing else.
 * It must never enter or alter cohort membership, historical analog matching, historical
 * intensity rates, landfall rates, Wilson intervals, effective sample size, calibration,
 * reliability, the archive comparison, an event gate, refusal logic, or zero-peek replay
 * semantics.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A CONVENTION. The failure it prevents is silent and it is
 * attractive: `scoreCases` takes an untyped array of plain objects and reads `peak_vmax_kt` off
 * each one, so a future live-aware case builder would put an operational wind straight into an
 * intensity rate, a Wilson interval and an ESS with nothing between it and the number on screen.
 * The archive would then publish a rate that is not the archive's, under the archive's name, and
 * every existing test would still pass -- because every existing test asks whether the arithmetic
 * is right, not whose numbers went into it.
 *
 * TWO HALVES, BECAUSE THEY FAIL FOR DIFFERENT REASONS:
 *
 *   [A] THE IMPORT GRAPH. Nothing that computes a historical result may reach engine/live.js,
 *       transitively. This catches the leak the day it is written, in the diff, before anyone
 *       has to reason about whether a particular number moved.
 *
 *   [B] THE OUTPUTS. Every historical result is computed with the live artifact absent and again
 *       with it loaded, and the two are compared field by field. This catches a leak that
 *       arrives some other way -- through a mutated column, a shared cache, a global.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/test-atlas-live-boundary.mjs
