/* Is docs/storm-atlas/dist/ actually what docs/storm-atlas/src/ compiles to?
 *
 * The Atlas ships precompiled output and commits it, which buys a permanent URL that depends on
 * no toolchain at read time and costs the pipeline's 3.1 MB in-browser Babel. It invites exactly
 * one failure in return: the committed bundle stops being what the source says. Someone edits
 * dist/ directly to fix something quickly; someone changes a component and forgets to rebuild;
 * a rebase resolves a conflict in the minified file. In every case the source stops being the
 * truth and nothing says so.
 *
 * So this rebuilds from source with the pinned esbuild and byte-compares. Same discipline as
 * scripts/verify-extraction.mjs -- "a pure move that shifts a probability by 1e-16 is not a
 * pure move" -- applied to a bundle rather than an estimator.
 *
 * It fails loudly rather than skipping when esbuild is missing, for the same reason
 * check-jsx.mjs exits 2 in that case.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/test-atlas-build.mjs
