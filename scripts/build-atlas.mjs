/* Build the Storm Atlas bundle.
 *
 * the original pipeline transforms its JSX in the browser, which costs 3.1 MB of @babel/standalone and a
 * main-thread compile on every page load. That is a defensible trade for a surface with no
 * build step; it is not one for a surface whose whole claim is that it stays fast while holding
 * 224,153 track points in memory. So the Atlas ships PRECOMPILED, the way _ds_bundle.js already
 * does -- the precedent for committed, pre-transformed output is in this repo.
 *
 * WHY COMMITTED OUTPUT IS SAFE HERE. Committing build output invites exactly one failure:
 * someone edits dist/ and the source stops being the truth. scripts/test-atlas-build.mjs closes
 * that by re-running this build in CI and byte-comparing the result. A hand-edited bundle, or a
 * source change nobody rebuilt, fails the pull request. The permanent URL keeps serving static
 * files that depend on no toolchain at read time, which is the property the repo actually cares
 * about.
 *
 * React is bundled from npm and tree-shaken, in its production build -- about 140 KB against
 * the 1.19 MB of development React the original pipeline loads. Leaflet stays external as `window.L`, so
 * the Atlas and the original pipeline share one cached copy of it.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/build-atlas.mjs [--check]
