/* THE RESTING INSTRUMENT, AGAINST THE FROZEN FRAME, MEASURED IN THE REAL PAGE.
 *
 * WHAT THIS OWNS THAT NOTHING ELSE DOES. The other browser gates each hold one property across
 * every state: the aperture's bounds, the camera's persistence, every word's contrast, every
 * refusal's reachability. None of them asserts the RESTING SCREEN's own composition, and that
 * composition is a specification -- `5c · Minimal Research Instrument` -- with numbers in it.
 *
 * The five things below are the ones a layout change is most likely to lose quietly, in the
 * order they would be lost:
 *
 *   1  THE HIERARCHY.       The question dominates the page. A 30px serif sentence with the
 *                           cohort stated once beneath it, and no second rendering of the same
 *                           count anywhere in the head.
 *   2  THE PLATE.           One uninterrupted rectangle. Its metadata is set in PAPER above and
 *                           below it, aligned to its edges, and resolves paper ink -- a caption
 *                           left inside the dark subtree would be near-white on near-white.
 *   3  THE CLASS KEY.       Present wherever class-coloured tracks are, drawn from the plate's
 *                           OWN palette, with the major classes carrying extra stroke.
 *   4  THE SCALE BAR.       COMPUTED FROM THE RENDERED PLATE BOX, and geographically correct.
 *                           This is the one the frozen handoff singles out: a scale bar stored
 *                           as a constant is a measurement of a mock, and it is wrong on every
 *                           screen that is not the mock. So it is checked as GEOMETRY -- the
 *                           projection's own distance across the bar's pixels against the
 *                           distance the bar claims -- at every width, after a resize, and after
 *                           a zoom.
 *   5  THE LEDGER'S ENDS.   The column heads pinned to the top and the limits pinned to the
 *                           foot, so what the columns are and what the record does not hold are
 *                           on screen at every scroll position.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-atlas-instrument.mjs [--require-browser]
