/* Does the Epistemic Key define what the engine actually says?
 *
 * The Storm Atlas prints a refusal as a status line and explains that status once, in a key at
 * the foot of every panel. That only works while the two are the same sentence. The wording is
 * authored in docs/app/claims.js beside every other claim; the engine that DECIDES to refuse
 * lives in docs/storm-atlas/src/engine/analogs.js and carries its own copy of the string,
 * because it also runs in Node for the parity test where no claim registry exists.
 *
 * Two copies of a string is a drift waiting to happen, so this is the gate that makes it safe:
 * it reads both and requires them to be identical, character for character. The same argument
 * as the methodology version, which the browser also declares twice and which
 * scripts/test-atlas-parity.mjs also refuses to let diverge.
 *
 * It also checks the direction nobody thinks about: that the key defines every mark the panels
 * use, so a panel cannot introduce a sixth kind of refusal that the reader has no way to look
 * up.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/test-atlas-refusals.mjs
