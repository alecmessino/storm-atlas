/* Tests for the ATCF deck parsers — the highest-value feed on the board and the one
 * whose failure modes are silent.
 *
 * Every fixture here is a real record shape taken from live decks (acp012026,
 * aal942026, fcp012026, 14 Aug 2026), not an invented one. That matters: the two traps
 * these parsers exist to avoid are both things the live data actually does, and a
 * made-up fixture would not contain either.
 *
 *   1. TVCN, the track consensus, ships vmax=0 on every row because it has no intensity
 *      to give. Read as a forecast, that is a consensus predicting the storm dissipates
 *      to nothing — and it would drag every blend it touches down with it.
 *   2. One forecast appears on three rows, once per wind-radius threshold. Counted
 *      naively, one aid becomes three members and the "disagreement" between them is
 *      zero, so a spread that is supposed to widen the probability band collapses it.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/test-atcf.mjs
