/* Where a mark came from, and the one place the map decides how to say so.
 *
 * Two of the Atlas's visual distinctions are about PROVENANCE rather than about a storm: a
 * track portion that precedes genesis, and a landfall the archive derived instead of read.
 * Both already had an answer -- selection-layer.js states the rule in prose and implements it
 * for the selected storm -- and the answer simply never reached the population layer.
 *
 * SO THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP THE RULE BEING WRITTEN A FOURTH TIME. Before it, the pre-genesis
 * predicate lived at selection-layer.js twice and ui/transport.jsx once, and the three copies
 * had already drifted: two guarded genesis with `!Number.isNaN(g) && g !== I32_NULL` and one
 * with `g !== I32_NULL` alone. That is exactly the shape of divergence that ends with two
 * surfaces disagreeing about where a storm began, so the predicate is defined once here and
 * imported rather than retyped.
 *
 * THE INK CONSTANTS ARE THE ONES ALREADY SHIPPED. Nothing here is a new visual semantic. The
 * dash pattern and alpha are lifted verbatim from what the selected storm has always used, so
 * propagating the treatment cannot silently restyle the surface that already had it.

 * polygon. `segment_crossing` is derived: both bracketing fixes were over water and the
 * interpolated path cut the coast.
 *
 * DERIVED IS NOT INVALID, and the encoding must not read as a warning. For roughly forty years
 * of East Pacific landfalls a segment crossing is the ONLY answer that exists -- NHC did not
 * systematically flag them until about 1988 (geo.py:9-15) -- so a derived mark is the archive
 * doing its job, not failing at it. The distinction is carried in mark FORM, never in hue: the
 * landfall colour keeps its single job, and no landfall mark is ever coloured by category,
 * which is what preserves the withheld Saffir-Simpson class as withheld rather than letting a
 * mark imply a class the archive declined to publish.
