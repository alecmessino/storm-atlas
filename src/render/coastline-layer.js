/* The plate's cartographic ink: the archive's own coastline, and the graticule under it.
 *
 * TWO TIERS, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS A STATEMENT. The CONTEXT tier is Natural Earth 1:110m land
 * -- South America, Africa, Canada, the detail this archive's landfall rule never looks at --
 * packed with the archive (scripts/build-atlas-context.mjs) and drawn here at contextual ink,
 * in place of the third-party tile service the plate used to fetch. The five modelled regions
 * are drawn over it, from the archive's own rings, at full contrast. That contrast difference
 * is not decoration: it says where a landfall can be detected at all.
 *
 * COAST AND BORDER ARE DIFFERENT LINES. The source is admin-1, so Texas and Louisiana share an
 * edge and California meets the Pacific along one. An edge in two rings is interior to the land
 * union; an edge in one is on its boundary, and the boundary is what the crossing rule tests.
 * The split is computed once at build time (scripts/build-atlas-coastlines.mjs) and arrives in
 * the pack, so drawing a state line at half a pixel and a coast at a quarter more costs the
 * frame nothing.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS SIMPLIFIED AT DRAW TIME EITHER. The tracks are decimated by zoom because a
 * six-hourly fix is denser than the screen; the coast is not, because a decimated coast would
 * be a different coast from the one the archive tested, at exactly the zoom where a reader
 * looks closely to check a landfall.
