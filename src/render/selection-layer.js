/* The selected storm: its whole life, drawn over a population that has receded but not left.
 *
 * The lifecycle the brief asks to be legible --
 *     PRE-GENESIS -> GENESIS -> INTENSIFICATION -> PEAK -> LANDFALL / DISSIPATION
 * -- is drawn here as geometry rather than described in a table, and two of its stages exist
 * only because the archive is honest about things a best-track file usually hides:
 *
 * PRE-GENESIS IS REAL TRACK. The archive's genesis is the first TROPICAL fix, and 9,450 fixes
 * in this archive sit before it, as disturbances and lows, across 744 storms and reaching 252
 * hours back. Truncating the track at genesis would throw away observed positions; drawing them
 * like the rest would imply a storm existed before one did. They are drawn dimmed and named --
 * and, since this build, on the population layer as well as on the selected storm.
 *
 * Those three counts are ASSERTED, by scripts/test-atlas-provenance.mjs, against the pack the
 * browser loads. The previous version of this sentence said 1,580, and no definition of
 * pre-genesis reproduced it -- the rule was right and the sentence had gone stale. The archive
 * is rebuilt about four times a day, so a count written into a comment drifts by construction
 * unless something recomputes it.
 *
 * INTERPOLATION IS NOT OBSERVATION. Roughly half of all fixes were interpolated by IBTrACS
 * rather than observed, and the archive refuses to let an interpolated point establish a
 * threshold crossing. So an interpolated segment is dashed, and a crossing mark is only ever
 * drawn where the archive placed one -- on an observed fix.
