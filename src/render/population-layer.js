/* The historical population: every filtered track, its genesis points and its landfalls.
 *
 * This is the layer the brief calls the hero, and the one constraint that shapes it is that
 * 3,959 bright tracks are not a picture of anything. The default is deliberately restrained --
 * one ink, low alpha, so that where storms have actually gone emerges from accumulated overlap
 * rather than from 3,959 competing lines. Turning intensity on splits the same geometry into
 * seven category paths, which is still seven stroke calls rather than 224,153.
 *
 * WHY IT IS FAST. Three properties, all of them structural rather than clever:
 *   1. Positions were projected into a unit world square once at load, so a frame is a
 *      multiply per point (see atlas-layer.js).
 *   2. Segments are batched by colour, not by storm. A whole basin in one ink is ONE path and
 *      ONE stroke; in intensity mode it is seven. Per-storm strokes would be 3,959.
 *   3. Line geometry is decimated by zoom. MARKS ARE NOT: a genesis point, a threshold
 *      crossing and a landfall are drawn from the actual fix at every zoom, and hit-testing
 *      always uses full resolution. Decimation makes a line cheaper to draw; it must never
 *      make the archive look different.
