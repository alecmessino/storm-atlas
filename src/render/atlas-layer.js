/* The canvas layer everything draws on, and the projection that makes it fast.
 *
 * 224,153 track points cannot become DOM elements, and they cannot become Leaflet vector
 * layers either -- L.Polyline allocates an object and a path per storm and re-projects every
 * LatLng on every frame. So the Atlas draws into one canvas per concern and projects the
 * points itself.
 *
 * THE PROJECTION IS PRECOMPUTED ONCE AND IS THEN A MULTIPLY.
 * Web Mercator's y is a logarithm, and calling it 224,153 times per frame is most of a frame's
 * budget. But the expensive part -- ln(tan(pi/4 + lat/2)) -- does not depend on zoom at all: it
 * is a fixed position in a unit world square. So it is computed once at load into a pair of
 * Float32Arrays, and drawing a frame becomes `wx * scale` and `wy * scale`. Float32 costs about
 * eight thousandths of a pixel at the Atlas's deepest zoom, which is well under a hairline.
 *
 * PANNING DOES NOT REDRAW. The canvas lives inside a Leaflet pane, and Leaflet transforms its
 * panes during a drag, so a pan moves the already-drawn pixels for free. The canvas is sized
 * with padding beyond the viewport so that a drag can travel a way before it exposes an unpainted
 * edge; a redraw happens on moveend, zoomend and resize. A zoom animates by CSS transform and
 * redraws when it settles -- the same contract Leaflet's own renderer offers its vectors.

 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT. A storm crossing the antimeridian has consecutive fixes at
 * 179.9E and 179.9W. Projected independently those are wx 0.9997 and wx 0.0003, and the line
 * between them is drawn straight across the entire map -- a horizontal streak from one edge to
 * the other, through ocean the storm was never in. The archive has 341 storms with a West
 * Pacific genesis and 664 with a Central Pacific track point, so this is not an edge case here,
 * it is the Central Pacific.
 *
 * So x is accumulated ALONG each storm rather than computed per point: whenever a step would
 * jump more than half a world, a whole world is added or subtracted, and the track stays
 * continuous. A storm can then legitimately sit outside [0,1], which is why the layers draw at
 * world offsets of -1, 0 and +1 and cull by each storm's own x-range.
