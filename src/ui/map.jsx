/* The map, which is the page -- framed as a plate.
 *
 * Conventions are the pipeline's, deliberately: preferCanvas, the same zoom range and snap, and
 * the same three-mechanism resize discipline. Two surfaces of one product should not disagree
 * about how a map behaves, and the pipeline's map.jsx already learned each of these the hard
 * way.
 *
 * THE PRIMARY INTERACTION IS ON THE MAP ITSELF. Clicking a genesis point selects that storm.
 * Clicking open water asks the archive's central question at that point -- what formed near
 * here, and where did it go -- and answers it by revealing trajectories, not by opening a
 * dialog. That gesture has to be discoverable in one try, so it is the map that responds.
 *
 * THE CAPTION BANDS ARE SIBLINGS OF THE MAP, NOT OVERLAYS. A plate in a journal is captioned
 * above and below, outside the image, and nothing about the figure is ever hidden by its own
 * caption. So the stage is a three-row grid and the map occupies the middle row; the head band
 * says what is drawn and the foot band says at what scale, in what projection, and against
 * which coastline. An overlay would have been easier and would sit on top of the Gulf.
 *
 * TWO TIERS OF COASTLINE, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE POINT. The context tier -- South America,
 * Africa, Canada, everything the landfall rule never looks at -- is Natural Earth 1:110m land,
 * packed with the archive and drawn from this origin, held back to that role. The five modelled
 * regions are drawn over it from the archive's own rings, at full contrast, by
 * coastline-layer.js. A reader can see, without being told, where this archive can detect a
 * landfall at all. Nothing on the plate is fetched from a third party: the tile service the
 * plate used to draw its context from is gone, and scripts/test-atlas-context.mjs keeps it gone.

/**
 * Fit `frame` on the map, with an optional clamp the resulting VIEW may not leave.
 *
 * THE APERTURE BINDS ON LONGITUDE, AND THAT IS THE RULE BOTH EARLIER MODELS WERE REACHING FOR.
 *
 * `fitBounds` CONTAINS: it shows the whole frame and whatever else the plate's shape demands on
 * the looser axis. With a 3.19-shaped frame on a 3.84-shaped plate that surplus is 100 degrees
 * of longitude, and it opened a plate captioned NORTH ATLANTIC + EAST PACIFIC on the Philippine
 * Sea. So the aperture COVERED instead, which binds on the axis the plate is tighter in.
 *
 * That was the same rule stated in terms of one plate shape, and it stopped being true when the
 * plate changed shape. The instrument's plate is 834x541 beside its ledger rather than 1920x500
 * above its deck -- aspect 1.54 against the frame's projected 2.89 -- and a cover fit on a plate
 * SQUARER than its frame binds on LATITUDE and crops the other axis. Measured at 1440: longitude
 * 128.5W to 55.2W, seventy-three degrees, with the East Pacific development region off the left
 * edge of a plate captioned for it. check-atlas-camera caught it, which is what it is for.
 *
 * `aperture` states the rule directly: the frame's LONGITUDE is what fills the plate, always.
 * On a plate wider than its frame that is what cover did; on a squarer one it is what contain
 * does; and it is never either of their failure modes, because it never consults the plate's
 * shape at all. Latitude is whatever follows -- bounded, as it always was, by the clamp below,
 * which is the research geography and the only thing that decides what a reader may open on.
 *
 * SNAP IS FLOORED, NOT CEILED. Leaflet quantises zoom to zoomSnap; ceiling a cover fit would
 * crop up to a fifth of the frame away to satisfy the snap. Flooring shows slightly MORE than
 * the frame instead, which is the direction an aperture is allowed to be wrong in.
 *
 * THE CLAMP IS A SEPARATE STEP AND IT OUTRANKS THE FIT. It raises the zoom until the clamp box
 * covers the plate -- so no view outside it is reachable at that zoom -- and then pans the
 * result back inside, in projected pixels rather than in degrees, since a degree of latitude is
 * not a fixed number of pixels in Mercator.

          move is to take both strips off: the plate becomes one uninterrupted rectangle and its
          metadata is set in paper immediately above and below it, which is how a plate in a
          journal is captioned. It also returns the 58px the two bands were using.

          THE TWO FIGURES ARE THE ONE THING ON THIS LINE A READER CHECKS. They reconcile the ink
          with the ledger: COHORT is what is lifted and is the denominator of every rate beside
          it, CONTEXT is the population drawn behind it. Unfiltered they are the same number, so
          only one is printed -- "3,959 COHORT · 3,959 CONTEXT" states nothing twice.

          THE APERTURE IS READ OFF THE MAP, NOT WRITTEN HERE. It is the plate's STATED aperture
          in the sense the locked rules use -- the bounds a coordinate readout is legal inside --
          so it has to be the bounds actually rendered, and it moves when the reader pans. A
          fixed pair of coordinates under a movable camera is a caption that becomes a lie on the
          first drag. */}

          The Saffir-Simpson key is not decoration and it is never dropped for minimalism: the
          plate colours every fix by the class it had reached, and a coloured map with no key is
          a map that cannot be read. It is compact and subordinate -- 9.5px mono, the smallest
          step the frame has -- but it is present wherever class-coloured tracks are.

          THE SCALE BAR IS COMPUTED, NOT STATED. `measure()` asks the projection how far 100px
          is at the plate's own centre latitude, at the size the plate actually rendered, and
          snaps the bar to a round distance. It moves with a pan and with a resize, and there is
          no constant anywhere in this file that a layout change could leave stale.

          THE LIVE COORDINATE NOW SITS ON PAPER, which is 5c's one named risk: during a pan the
          numbers change just off the map. Left-aligned to the plate's own edge and immediately

       * in a paragraph: what the ink is, that five landfall regions are drawn at full contrast
       * while every other coastline is context, that the landfall rule never consults the
       * basemap, and the two gestures. On this machine that set five lines. Under a runner's
       * fallback fonts it set eight, and because it names the cohort count it RE-WRAPPED when a
       * condition changed -- so the figure column's chrome grew, and the plate, which was what
       * was left of the band after it, paid for the reflow. That is the aperture invariant
       * broken by prose. At 1024 the same paragraph was eating the fold budget the map needed.
       *
       * SO THE CAPTION STATES THE FIGURE AND NOTHING ELSE: how many storms are drawn, and the
       * one thing about THIS cohort's drawing that a reader cannot get from the plate itself.
       * Three states, because there are three things a plate here can be -- a cohort inside a
       * drawn condition, a cohort over the archive behind it, or the archive itself. The third
       * is `context === kept`, which is the same test the plate head already uses to decide
       * whether to print a CONTEXT figure at all: with nothing conditioned the cohort IS the
       * archive, and "over the archive behind them" would be describing a layer that is the
       * same storms drawn twice.
       *
       * NOTHING IS DELETED. The coastline claim, the projection and the gestures are in PLATE
       * NOTES, one press away, stated at more length than the caption ever gave them.
       *
       * THE DEGRADED COASTLINE STAYS IN THE CAPTION, at full weight, and is the one thing that
       * may take a second line. With the archive's rings absent the plate is drawing a coastline
       * the landfall rule was never written against; that is not something a reader should have
       * to open anything to discover, and it is a state the surface should be shouting about
       * rather than economising on. It cannot move the plate either way -- see the declared
       * stage height in atlas.css. */}

 * near-black stage; on paper #4fc3f7 measures 1.8:1, which is below the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks of
 * a graphical object that carries meaning. So the swatch is a tile of the stage's own ink with
 * the class stroke inside it -- a two-millimetre sample of the plate rather than a colour chip.
 * The identity ink is unchanged, the contrast is the contrast the reader sees on the map itself,
 * and the sample says what it is a sample OF.
 *
 * THE MAJOR CLASSES CARRY THE EXTRA STROKE HERE TOO. MAJOR_WEIGHT is 1.35 on the plate, and the
 * key's strokes are 3px and 4px for the same reason: the cat2/cat3 pair decides "major
