/* Where every number on this screen came from.
 *
 * The archive's provenance discipline is not a footnote on this product, it is the product, so
 * this drawer is one keystroke away rather than buried: the sources and their hashes, the two
 * versions that govern what is shown, every gap the archive recorded about its own inputs, the
 * columns it holds that carry no data, and the places the Atlas itself made a choice -- the
 * coordinate quantisation, the line decimation, and the geometry the plate draws its coastline
 * from.
 *
 * Nothing here is written by hand. Every value is read from the pack the browser loaded.
 *
 * SET AS A COLOPHON, NOT AS A MODAL. A serif heading, a rule under it, and the record beneath:
 * this is the back matter of the plate, and it should read like it.
