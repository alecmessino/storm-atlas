/* THE CALIBRATION LEDGER.
 *
 * Every other surface here answers "what does the record say". This one answers the question a
 * serious reader asks immediately afterwards, and that almost no analytical product will answer
 * about itself: IS ANY OF THIS ANY GOOD?
 *
 * It is a first-class surface rather than a panel, because the answer is not an annotation on
 * the product -- it is the product's warrant. A reader who cannot find it cannot audit anything
 * else on the site, and a reader who finds only its flattering half has been sold something.
 *
 * SO IT LEADS WITH BOTH HALVES.
 *
 *   The clean half: of the eight contracts the replay could score, six beat climatology. The
 *   fewest replay events on a contract WITH skill is 57; the most on one WITHOUT is 6. Nothing
 *   sits between. Skill is a function of how many events the replayed population actually
 *   carried, and the separation is a gap rather than a trend.
 *
 *   The other half: the refusal gate that is supposed to protect a reader from the second group
 *   counts events ARCHIVE-WIDE, not within the population a query can draw from. CONUS landfall
 *   has 699 events archive-wide and one in the east-Pacific replay. The gate passes it; the
 *   method scores worse than climatology on it. Of the four contracts that earned no skill
 *   claim, the gate catches one.
 *
 * The second half is a defect in the gate, and publishing it is the whole argument for the
 * ledger existing. Fixing it changes what both surfaces refuse and is a METHODOLOGY_VERSION
 * decision, not something this page should do quietly.
 *
 * WHAT IS COPIED VERBATIM, AND WHY. `conditions_on` and `cannot_answer` are the harness's own
 * words. The second is the more important: this backtest says nothing about whether a
 * disturbance becomes a storm at all, because the failures are absent from the best-track
 * archive. A calibration page that let a reader carry these numbers over to that question would
 * be claiming skill at the one thing it never tested.
