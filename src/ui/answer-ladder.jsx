/* THE ANSWER, BESIDE THE PLATE, IN EIGHT ROWS.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES AND WHY. The evidence ledger used to hold the right-hand column: every
 * contract this cohort can be asked -- sixteen to eighteen rows -- inside a 486px measure that
 * scrolled 3,457px of deck through a 673px window. Measured on the deployed surface at 1440 with
 * one genesis-radius condition set. That is not an answer beside a map; it is the whole evidence
 * base wearing an answer's position, and it failed in three ways at once: the reader could not
 * see the finding without scrolling, the plate lost width to a table that never fit anyway, and
 * the refusal prose repeated after every row it governed.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS NOW A SELECTION, AND THE SELECTION IS DECLARED. Six intensity rows -- the whole
 * ladder, because omitting rungs from an ordered scale is an editorial claim about which
 * thresholds matter -- then the two landfall contracts this cohort actually turns on. Eight, and
 * the number is fixed: what is not among them is one screen below in the complete matrix, at page
 * width, with the eight underscored so the relationship is visible rather than asserted.
 *
 * WHICH TWO LANDFALLS, AND WHO DECIDES. The engine does. buildGroups orders landfall regions by
 * the count the archive holds, so the first rows are the ones this cohort's storms actually
 * reached; this file takes the first two that publish a rate, and where none does -- a cohort
 * below the sample gate -- the first two by count, which are the two the reader would ask about.
 * Nothing is hand-picked per cohort and no region is named in this file.
 *
 * A REFUSED ROW KEEPS THE ROW AND LOSES ONLY THE RATE. Where the archive publishes no rate the
 * COUNT stands in the rate's place, at the rate's size, because the count is the finding -- the
 * same argument the deck already makes for the unrecorded-outcome total. The row carries its
 * state word. It carries no sentence: the sentence is written once, per governing refusal, in
 * Limits & exclusions below the matrix.
