/* THE EVIDENCE DECK — one table where six panel sections used to be.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT IS ONE GRID.
 *
 * The panel published intensity as a ladder, landfall as a nested list of regions, timing as its
 * own section, and pathway and environment as two more. Five shapes, five denominators, five
 * places to learn a new layout -- and an analyst comparing "did these storms get stronger, come
 * ashore more often, or take longer to do it" had to hold three different renderings in their
 * head to answer one question. Here every outcome domain is a ROW GROUP on the same axis, timing
 * is a pair of COLUMNS rather than a section, and status is a column that reads the same way in
 * every row.
 *
 * THE RULE THAT SURVIVES INTACT: the four panel rules of outcome-card.jsx are not relaxed by
 * being tabulated.
 *
 *   1. NO BARE PERCENTAGE. The rate cell never renders without the count cell and the interval
 *      cell in the same row. That is now structural rather than editorial -- they are three
 *      cells of one grid row and cannot be separated by a layout change.
 *   2. A REFUSED RATE PRINTS ITS REFUSAL, never 0.0%. The rate cell holds an em dash and the
 *      STATUS cell holds the word. A refusal never inflates to the rate's size.
 *   3. AN UNSCOREABLE CONTRACT PRINTS ITS OWN COUNTS -- what it has against what it needs.
 *   4. THE QUALIFICATION TRAVELS WITH THE NUMBERS. A status word sits in its own row and is
 *      never hoisted, aggregated, or summarised into a count of qualifications.
 *
 * THE FAILURE MODE THIS FILE IS BUILT AGAINST is a status detaching from its row. In a list of
 * blocks a refusal is physically attached to the thing it refuses; in a grid, every cell is a
 * sibling of every other cell, and a row that renders its status one cell late puts "RATE
 * REFUSED" beside a real percentage belonging to a different contract. So the row is a single
 * element with `display:contents` and every cell is authored inside it -- there is no code path
 * that emits a cell outside its row -- and scripts/check-evidence-deck.mjs asserts, per row, that
 * a refused contract renders no rate anywhere within it.
 *
 * NINE COLUMNS, EIGHT HEADINGS. MED h and P25-P75 are two tracks under one heading, because they
 * are one statement about duration and a reader reads them together.

 *
 * THE LOCKED RESEARCH-TABLE HIERARCHY IS `OUTCOME | n / N | RATE | 95% WILSON`, and the two
 * changes from the deck it replaces are both subtractions.
 *
 * THE WIDE BAR IS GONE. It was a 110px-minimum track carrying the rate as a length, the interval
 * as a band and the archive baseline as a tick -- a second, softer rendering of the two columns
 * beside it, competing with them for the same eye at four times the width. What magnitude
 * encoding survives is a 3px hairline in the row's own class ink, inside the outcome cell: enough
 * to group the ladder by class at a glance, too little to be read as a second answer.
 *
 * THE INTERVAL TAKES A COLUMN OF ITS OWN. It shared the rate's cell so that "89.2% [88.1-90.1%]"
 * read as one statement, which it is -- but the frozen table heads it `95% WILSON`, and a
 * bracketed suffix under a heading that names it is the same value stated twice. Panel rule 1 is
 * unchanged and is what the gates assert: A PUBLISHED RATE IMPLIES A COUNT AND AN INTERVAL ON
 * THE SAME ROW. `.at-dc-int` is still the element that carries it, one track to the right.
 *
 * `timing` false simply removes the two duration tracks. The control that restores them is a
 * line of its own beneath the rows rather than a ninth column: at a 486px measure a track spent
 * on a fold is a track taken from an outcome name. */
/* THE DECK'S TRACKS, AND STATUS IS NO LONGER ONE OF THEM.
 *
 * TWO THINGS CHANGED HERE AND BOTH EXIST TO STOP THE LEDGER'S MEASURE MOVING THE MAP.
 *
 * THE COMPARISON COLUMN IS SUMMONED. ITS WIDTH IS RESERVED. THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.
 *
 * `vs` is pushed into this list only once a comparison exists, and no `.at-dc-vs` cell and no
 * `VS ARCHIVE` heading is rendered before then -- an empty column under that heading claims a
 * comparison the deck is not making, which check-atlas-acceptance asserts against in as many
 * words. But the WIDTH it will need is held open from the start, as a trailing track that no
 * cell claims (see `deckTemplate`), so the four resting columns land on exactly the same
 * x-positions whether or not a condition exists.
 *
 * WHY BOTH HALVES MATTER. `--at-ledger` used to widen from 33.75vw to 41vw under
 * `:has(.at-dc-vs)` to make room for the sixth column. That came out of `--at-plate-avail`,
 * which bounds the plate: measured at 1440, one condition took the plate from 834x499 to 730x437
 * and the camera from zoom 3.25 to 3.00, three degrees north, with the reader's hands nowhere
 * near the map. Retiring the status track pays for the comparison inside the measure the ledger
 * already had; reserving its width stops the ledger's own columns shifting under the reader when
 * it arrives. scripts/check-atlas-stability.mjs asserts the first, and the deck's own geometry
 * is what makes the second true rather than approximately true.
 *
 * STATUS IS A LINE, NOT A COLUMN, AT EVERY WIDTH. It was already this below 1340 and below 480,
 * for the reason that applies at every width: a 14-term controlled vocabulary set at 9.5px in
 * the rightmost, most-droppable track is the least legible thing on the row whose whole content,
 * when it refuses, IS the qualification. Promoting the narrow treatment is also what pays for
 * the reserved comparison track -- five tracks and four gutters measure 468 against the 486
 * measure, where six and five would measure 556 and scroll the ledger sideways at the canonical
 * width. The CELL is still emitted on every row, the head's included: it is what the DOM gates
 * read, what check-atlas-published-values captures, and what keeps a status inside the row it
 * governs. It is emitted OUTSIDE this list and spans the row -- see DataRow. */

 * as absent. But moving it UP to the head was not available either: the archive's own sentence
 * reads "Intensity rates above are therefore biased LOW", so a block above the rates would make
 * the engine's text wrong about the page, and rewording a measured finding to suit a layout is
 * how a finding stops being one.
 *
 * Directly under the INTENSITY group satisfies both: "above" stays true, and it lands inside the

     many regions it holds AND how many of their contracts refused -- a fold that hid four
     refusals behind the word "more" would be hiding exactly what a reader needs to know is
     there. One click brings them all back, which is the rule for every fold on this surface.

     AND ABOVE 1440 NOTHING FOLDS, INCLUDING THE REGIONS WITH NO EVIDENCE. That was tried and
     reverted, and the reason is worth keeping.

     The case for folding them looks strong. On a 500 km cohort around CP012026's genesis the
     deck holds 26 storms, ONE observed crossing -- in Hawaii -- and eight further rows reading 0
     for Caribbean, Central America, CONUS and Mexico, four regions those storms never
     approached. Eight rows of zero under the one row that answers the question reads as the
     answer competing with four non-answers for the same eye, and folding them behind the summary
     put Hawaii and the intensity ladder alone above the fold.

     IT ALSO HID THE REFUSALS, WHICH ARE THE POINT. Six of those eight contracts publish no rate
     at all: they publish OUT OF SCOPE or BASE RATE ONLY. Methodology 1.1.0 split those two apart
     precisely so a zero could never be read as an empirical never -- the Florida click, where an
     Atlantic cohort was told its Hawaii landfall rate was 0.0% [0.0-3.2%] as a scoreable
     contract on the strength of eleven Pacific storms it could never contain. A fold keyed on
     "no evidence" folds exactly the rows whose whole content is the explanation of why there is
     none, and scripts/check-atlas-dom.mjs [4g] fails when it does.

     The prioritisation the fold was reaching for is already here and costs none of that: the
     list is ORDERED BY EVIDENCE, so Hawaii leads a Hawaii cohort and the four zeros follow it.

/* ── THE TABLE'S FOOT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * TWO BLOCKS THAT THE DELETED PANEL CARRIED AND THE DECK MUST NOT LOSE.
 *
 * The redesign folds thirteen comparison CARDS into one column of signed percentage points, and
 * that is the intended trade: the per-row question "by how much" is answered in the cell, and
 * "do the samples separate" is answered by the STATUS word. But two things a card carried are
 * not per-row at all, and deleting cohort-panel.jsx deleted them with it:
 *
 *   WHAT IS THE BASELINE   every "+5.1 pp" on this page is relative to something, and a reader
 *                          must not be able to scroll into a column of deltas without having
 *                          passed the sentence that names what they are deltas FROM.
 *   HOW ARE THE TWO POPULATIONS RELATED  the baseline CONTAINS the cohort, so the same storms
 *                          are on both sides and the two rates are not independent estimates.
 *                          engine/compare.js measures the relation and writes the sentence; the
 *                          surface's only job is to print it where the deltas are.
 *
 * Both are stated once, in the foot, because both are facts about the whole table. The HOLD OUT
 * control comes with them -- "what if I had not restricted the season" is one click rather than
 * a re-entry, and it is the control that makes the baseline a choice rather than a default. */
