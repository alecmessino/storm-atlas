/* THE QUERY IS THE PRODUCT.
 *
 * This replaced the filter rail. A rail is a list of switches over a schema; this is a question
 * being composed, and the difference is not cosmetic -- it decides what a reader believes they
 * are looking at. The old rail said "months: [8,9]". This says "storms that formed within 500 km
 * of 12.0N 105.0W, in Aug, Sep, since 1971 -- what happened next?", and the sentence at the top
 * is generated from the same object that selects the storms, so it cannot describe a cohort
 * other than the one on screen.
 *
 * THE ORDER IS THE STORM'S OWN LIFECYCLE, not the database's table layout:
 *
 *     GENESIS -> ENVIRONMENT -> TRAJECTORY -> INTENSITY -> LANDFALL -> OUTCOME
 *
 * so composing a query walks the path a storm walks. A researcher asks "where did it form, when,
 * what was it flying through, how strong did it get, where did it come ashore" -- in that order,
 * every time -- and the builder offers the conditions in that order for that reason.
 *
 * TWO ZONES, BECAUSE TWO KINDS OF CONDITION ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION.
 *   GIVEN            at or before genesis -- "what happens to storms that BEGIN like this?"
 *   GIVEN THAT ALSO  outcome-side        -- "what did the storms that ENDED UP like this have
 *                                            in common?"
 * Both are real research questions and conflating them is how circular reasoning enters. The
 * second zone is separated, and every chip in it states its own consequence BEFORE it is
 * clicked. The fifth rule then reads as the direct result of a choice the reader made, rather
 * than as the engine being difficult about a number it could obviously have produced.
 *
 * EVERY CHIP CARRIES ITS COUNT. Not the cohort's cost after the fact in a footnote -- the count
 * itself, on the control, before the click. See engine/preview.js for why those counts are taken
 * over the population that satisfies every OTHER condition, and for the consequence that makes
 * the outcome zone honest: an outcome-side chip's preview count IS the outcome count on the card
 * above it.
