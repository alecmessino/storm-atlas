/* THE COLOPHON — identity, provenance and the citation, on one line at the foot.
 *
 * WHAT THIS REPLACES. The surface used to open with two rows above the question: an identity
 * strip carrying the wordmark, three archive counts and the method stamp, and a question line
 * carrying the sentence, the cohort figure and CITE. Sixty-two pixels of chrome, read once a
 * session, sitting between a reader and the thing they came for.
 *
 * `5c` moves all of it to the foot. That is not decoration and it is not a demotion: a plate's
 * authority comes from its provenance being REACHABLE and its numbers being honest, not from a
 * wordmark at top-left, and a colophon under a printed plate is the convention this instrument
 * is already borrowing everything else from. The surface does not scroll, so the foot is on
 * screen at every width the instrument is side-by-side at -- one glance away rather than one
 * scroll -- and the top of the screen is the question and nothing else.
 *
 * IT IS A BET, AND THE RISK IS NAMED. Moving identity to the foot could read as art-directed
 * rather than institutional. The mitigation is that nothing became harder to reach: every item
 * here was in the strip, in the same words, and the two controls that open provenance and the
 * calibration ledger keep their hooks, their titles and their keyboard route.

/* THE ARCHIVE'S SCALE, AT THREE FIGURES RATHER THAN FIVE.
 *
 * WHICH THREE, AND WHY THE OTHER TWO LEFT. The line's job is to say how big the thing being
 * consulted is, in one glance, once a session. Storms, track points and landfalls do that:
 * they are the three denominators the surface actually publishes rates over, and a reader who
 * has them can tell whether "390 cohort" is a slice or a rounding error.
 *
 * GENESIS EVENTS is 3,959 -- the same number as STORMS on every pack this archive has ever
 * built, because the archive keys one genesis per storm. Printing it beside STORMS spent a
 * whole item of a degrading line restating the item next to it. ENVIRONMENT OBS is 32,940 and
 * counts rows of a table under half the cohort can be evaluated against; as a headline it reads
 * as scale and it is a COVERAGE fact, which is the env lens's to state and does.
 *
 * Both are in the provenance drawer, in section 02, where every count in the manifest is listed
 * from the pack that was actually loaded -- so nothing was dropped, it was filed.
