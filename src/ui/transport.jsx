/* Replay along a storm's actual track.
 *
 * THE READOUT COMES FROM A FIX, NOT FROM THE ANIMATION. The head moves smoothly because it is
 * interpolated along the segment between the two fixes that bracket the cursor, but every
 * number beside it -- the wind, the class, the position, the hours since genesis -- is read
 * from the fix in force. Interpolating a wind to make the counter run smoothly would be
 * inventing an observation, which is the one thing this archive will not do to look better.
 *
 * The clock is the storm's own. Elapsed time is real hours between real timestamps, never a
 * frame index times a nominal step -- the original pipeline learned that when a 4-frame scrub turned out
 * to be hours rather than an hour.
 *
 * REDUCED MOTION HALVES THE FRAMES, NOT THE RUN. Where a reader has asked for less movement the
 * clock ticks half as often and steps twice as far: the same storm over the same hours, watched
 * in fewer moving frames rather than in a shorter or a different replay. Nothing autoplays in
 * either mode; the transport only ever runs because someone pressed it.

 * scrubbing the archive stub would run the head off the end of a track nine days shorter than
 * the line underneath it -- the same class of failure as the cursor-at-t0 bug this file already
 * records, where the panel and the map described different things.
 *
 * `operational` is null for every storm but a current one, and the archive branch below is
 * byte-for-byte the reads this component always did. Nothing about the 3,958 archive storms
 * changes.
 *
 * QUALITY IS NOT INVENTED FOR THE OPERATIONAL BRANCH. A b-deck has no interpolated rows, so the
 * readout says `operational` -- the source's own word for what every one of its fixes is --
 * rather than borrowing the archive's `observed`, which means something the archive measured. */
