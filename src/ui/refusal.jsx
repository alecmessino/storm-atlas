/* THE FIVE REFUSALS.
 *
 * When the archive will not answer, this is what says so. It is not an error surface -- nothing
 * has gone wrong -- it is the part of the product that makes every number beside it worth
 * believing. An archive that answers everything is an archive that is guessing somewhere.
 *
 * THE DISTINCTION THAT MATTERS MOST IS NOT WHY, IT IS WHETHER THE READER CAN DO ANYTHING.
 * Three of these dissolve if the reader asks a different question. Two do not, and no cohort
 * that can be built will make them go away. Presenting the second kind with a suggestion --
 * "try widening the radius" -- would be a more comfortable lie than refusing outright, because
 * it sends the reader looking for a number the record does not contain. So the two irreducible
 * states are drawn in a flat, unactionable grey with a dashed rule and say, in as many words,
 * that this is a limit of the record.
 *
 *   RATE REFUSED    the sample is below the archive's gate. Counts still publish.   RESOLVABLE
 *   CONDITIONED ON  this variable defined the cohort -- the fifth rule.             RESOLVABLE
 *   OUT OF SCOPE    the events exist, somewhere this query cannot reach.            RESOLVABLE
 *   NOT EVALUABLE   no environment record near genesis for these storms.            PARTLY
 *   BASE RATE ONLY  the WHOLE archive holds too few events for any skill claim.     IRREDUCIBLE
 *   -- UNKNOWN      the outcome was never recorded. Out of the denominator, counted. IRREDUCIBLE
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE ARRIVED WITH METHODOLOGY 1.1.0 AND IT SPLIT BASE RATE ONLY IN TWO. The gate used
 * to count events across the whole archive, so every refusal it produced claimed to be a limit
 * of the record. Measured, exactly one contract is: hawaii:hurricane, at two events. The rest
 * were limits of the POPULATION THE QUERY ASKED ABOUT -- a Florida cohort was being told its
 * Hawaii landfall rate was 0.0% [0.0-3.2%] on the strength of eleven Pacific storms it could
 * never contain. Those are now OUT OF SCOPE, they are resolvable, and they say where the events
 * actually are. BASE RATE ONLY keeps its sentence, which is once again true.
 *
 * Each carries a distinct mark and distinct wording, so which refusal fired is legible without
 * reading the sentence. check-atlas-dom asserts all five reach the screen and that no two of
 * them say the same thing.
 *
 * THE COLOUR ROLE IS GONE, AND THE MARK IS WHAT REPLACED IT. These states used to be drawn in
 * three tones -- `--neg`, `--warn`, `--text-2` -- carried on a title, a tinted panel and a
 * coloured left bar. In the resting instrument that is a second vocabulary: the frame keeps one
 * ink for what the surface SAYS and reserves the palette for the cartography, so a refusal
 * printed in a warning hue reads as an error in the argument rather than as part of it. Nothing
 * was distinguished by the tone that is not still distinguished: the mark, the title and the
 * remedy kicker each name the state, and the resolvable/irreducible split -- the only one that
 * decides what a reader can DO -- is drawn as the rule above the block, solid or dashed.

/* One definition per state. The UI reads this; it never writes its own copy of a refusal, for
   the same reason the gaps are reproduced verbatim -- prose written twice drifts.
 *
 * `claim` names this state's row in the pipeline's Epistemic Key (docs/app/claims.js). The two
 * surfaces necessarily hold two vocabularies -- the key is a reader-facing glossary shared with
 * a pipeline that knows nothing about cohorts -- but the CORRESPONDENCE is data, declared here
 * once, so scripts/test-atlas-refusals.mjs can prove every state the Atlas can print has a row
 * a reader can look it up in, and that no row describes a state nothing prints. */

     *
     * This refusal used to carry a single sentence -- "Dropping the environmental condition

     * NO ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION IS OFFERED. Twice per page, the surface told the reader to
     * remove a control that does not exist. That is worse than an unhelpful remedy: a reader
     * who believes they set a condition they never set does not trust the count either.

     * The distinction the two sentences draw is the one that decides what a reader can DO, and
     * it is the same distinction the brief names:
     *
     *   recordLimit   the observations do not exist for these storms. Nothing in the query put
     *                 them outside the record and nothing in the query brings them back; what a
     *                 reader CAN do is ask a question the record reaches.
     *   queryCaused   a condition the reader set is what removed the evidence, so dropping it
     *                 restores the cohort -- and still cannot restore the observations.
     *
     * `remedy` is the record-limit case because that is the only one this build can reach: the
     * environment is a LENS and not a filter, so no environmental condition can be active. The
     * second sentence is kept rather than deleted because it becomes the true one the day a
     * condition is offered, and a remedy written fresh at that point would be a remedy nobody
