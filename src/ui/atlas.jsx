/* STORM ATLAS -- the shell.
 *
 * What the first ten seconds have to do, in order:
 *   1. Put the archive's scale on screen. The manifest is a few kilobytes and arrives first,
 *      so the counts are legible before the track block has finished downloading.
 *   2. Draw the population. Restrained by default -- one ink at low alpha, so the shape of
 *      where storms actually go emerges from overlap rather than from 3,959 competing lines.
 *   3. Make the question obvious. Clicking open water asks it; trajectories answer it on the
 *      map, not in a dialog.
 *
 * The map is the page. Everything else explains what is on it.

   * position part-way along the track is where the storm WAS at an instant, and every rate a
   * cohort publishes is conditioned on where storms FORMED. Matching on a mid-track position
   * would quietly ask a question this archive does not answer.
   *
   * EVERY OTHER CONDITION SURVIVES. The spec keeps its months, seasons, basin and outcome-side
   * conditions and replaces only the location, so the bridge narrows the reader's own question
   * rather than substituting a different one. What it added or replaced is named on the panel. */

  /* LAUNCHING FROM AN ACTIVE SYSTEM. A CLEAN question, and the difference from `onBridge` is

   * `onBridge` NARROWS the question already on screen: a reader looking at a cohort asks "and
   * around this storm's genesis", so every other condition they set survives, because they set
   * it and it is still their question.
   *
   * A LAUNCH IS NOT THAT GESTURE. The reader has named a live storm and asked what the archive
   * says about storms that formed where it formed. Carrying their previous conditions across
   * that gesture writes the most dangerous sentence this surface could publish: a cohort still
   * conditioned on `landfall: mexico` from ten minutes ago, now labelled with a live storm's
   * name, publishing a Mexico landfall rate that is 100% by construction and reading as a
   * forecast for that storm. So `genesisOnlySpec` starts from EMPTY_COHORT.
   *
   * THE RADIUS SURVIVES AND NOTHING ELSE DOES. It is the aperture of the question rather than a
   * condition on the storms -- 250 km and 500 km are two readings of one question -- and it is
   * the control a reader actually works. The policy is applied HERE, at the call site, and the
   * launcher prints it above the button before the click.
   *
   * THE SELECTION IS CLEARED. A launch is a question about a place, not about the archive storm
   * that happened to be open; leaving an unrelated storm selected beside a freshly launched

/* THE OPENING VIEW.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE ARCHIVE'S FULL EXTENT. `genesisBounds` returns the min/max of every genesis
 * coordinate, and this archive holds 343 storms with a West Pacific genesis -- IBTrACS keeps
 * dateline crossers in the loaded basin files -- so its longitude range runs -179.8 to +180.0.
 * That is 359.8 degrees, and fitting it opened the plate on the entire planet at the minimum
 * zoom: measured, latitude -88.5 to +89.4 on a 1920x1742 workstation, Antarctica and the Arctic
 * both on screen and 13.7% of the plate carrying any track ink. The reader met a dark void with
 * a band in it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FRAMES INSTEAD. The archive's own mass, in three measured steps and nothing else:
 *
 *   1. THE DOMINANT LOBE. Longitude is bimodal here -- a North Atlantic / East Pacific lobe and
 *      a West Pacific tail of 343 storms, with 128 degrees of empty longitude between them:
 *      from 14W to 114E this archive holds not one genesis. The lobe is taken as every genesis
 *      within LOBE_DEG of the archive's MEDIAN genesis longitude, measured the short way round.
 *      Measured on this pack: 3,588 of 3,905 storms, 91.9%, which is precisely the North
 *      Atlantic plus East Pacific the plate is titled for.
 *   2. ITS CORE LONGITUDE, at the 1st and 99th percentile of that lobe. Percentiles rather than
 *      extremes because one storm at 179.8W should not widen the opening view by 15 degrees.
 *   3. ITS LATITUDE BAND -- a TROPICAL/RECURVATURE band rather than the full extent of the ink.
 *      The floor comes from the lobe's GENESIS latitudes at q0.5 (7.2N on this pack): nothing
 *      forms below the deep tropics, and the archive's single 1.9N genesis should not pull the
 *      band down five degrees on its own. The ceiling comes from the lobe's TRACK latitudes at
 *      q97.5 (47.4N): the plate draws whole trajectories, and a storm that forms at 12N and
 *      recurves to 45N occupies all of that -- but the last 2.5% of fixes are extratropical
 *      tails running to 66N, and framing for them opens the plate on the Labrador Sea.
 *
 * WHAT IT COMES OUT AS, on this pack: 7.2N to 47.4N, 166.3W to 17.4W. That is 148.9 degrees of
 * longitude against 40.2 of latitude -- in Web Mercator a band 3.19 times wider than it is tall,
 * which is within a hundredth of the plate's own 3.2 ceiling. That is the point of the band:
 * FRAME AND PLATE ARE THE SAME SHAPE, so at a workstation width the fit is nearly exact in both
 * axes and neither a crop nor a margin of empty ocean is doing any work. 98.6% of the lobe's
 * track fixes are inside it.
 *
 * AND IT IS CLAMPED, WHICH IS THE PART A PERCENTILE CANNOT DO. Percentiles bound the FRAME; they
 * do not bound the VIEW, and the view is what a reader sees. Measured on the previous model at
 * 1920x1080: the frame was 2.14 wide against a 3.04 plate, so the contain fit bound on latitude
 * and opened 253 degrees of longitude -- 141E to 34E, the whole West Pacific and half of Asia,
 * on a plate captioned NORTH ATLANTIC + EAST PACIFIC. NA_EP below is the research geography the
 * plate declares, and applyFrame in map.jsx will not open a view outside it.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS A CLAIM. It is a camera position, derived from coordinates the pack already
 * holds, and it changes only where the map opens: pan, zoom and every filter behave exactly as
 * before, and the West Pacific is one drag away. The percentiles are stated here rather than
 * tuned by eye so the framing moves with the archive if the archive moves.

 * the reason the percentiles above are taken over a LOBE rather than over everything), and the
 * prime meridian east (the archive's easternmost genesis is 9.5W).
 *

 * it forbids is the surface OPENING on geography it does not research. */

/* WHERE THE APERTURE IS CENTRED, WHICH IS NOT THE MIDDLE OF WHAT IT FRAMES.

 * degrees west of where the storms are, because the East Pacific tail is longer than the
 * Atlantic one. That costs nothing while the plate is wide enough to show the whole range, and
 * it costs the Atlantic main development region the moment the plate is not.
 *
 * The instrument's plate is 777px beside the answer at 1440 under the contract's split, and the
 * research clamp allows about 133 of the frame's 149 degrees at that shape -- so sixteen degrees
 * are cropped and WHICH sixteen is a decision somebody has to make. Centred on the median it is the sparse ends of both tails;

 * storm forms further west, a median does not. Measured on this pack: 79.4W, 15.5N. Nothing here
 * is typed -- it is read from the same genesis columns `coreFrame` frames -- so it moves with the
 * archive rather than needing to be re-measured by hand when the archive grows. */
