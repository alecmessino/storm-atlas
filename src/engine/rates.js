/* The conditioned rates, transliterated from scripts/genesis/retrieval/analogs.py.
 *
 * This is the half Phase 1 refused. The Atlas answered "which storms formed here and where did
 * they go" and returned UNSCOREABLE -- REQUIRES CANONICAL COMPUTATION wherever a rate belonged,
 * because a rate the browser computed a cheaper way is not a smaller version of the archive's
 * answer, it is a different answer wearing its clothes. Nothing here is cheaper. `_rate` at
 * analogs.py:370, `wilson_interval` at :202 and `_pct` at :187 are reproduced operation for
 * operation, and scripts/test-atlas-parity.mjs compares the results field by field.
 *
 * THE FOUR RULES THIS FILE EXISTS TO KEEP (analogs.py:14-30)
 *   1. A rate is refused below min_sample. Counts are always returned.
 *   2. The sample is STORMS, not track points.
 *   3. Effective sample size is published beside every rate, and the gate is applied to the RAW
 *      distinct-storm count, never to the flattering ESS.
 *   4. An absent outcome is not a zero -- unknowns leave the denominator and are counted.
 *
 * AND A FIFTH, WHICH IS THIS BUILD'S OWN -- see `circularOutcomes` below.

 * Port of `dist` (analogs.py:805): NaN and null dropped, then five linear-interpolated
 * quantiles over what remains. `n` is the count of USABLE values, not of cases.
 *
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * AND IT REFUSES BELOW THE SAMPLE GATE, WHICH IT DID NOT USED TO.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every rate this archive publishes refuses under `MIN_SAMPLE` and publishes its count. These
 * timings did not: `n` was returned and the quantiles beside it were computed over whatever was
 * there, so a surface rendering `timing.n ? median : "—"` published a median over one storm and
 * it read exactly like a median over a thousand.
 *
 * MEASURED, BEFORE THIS GATE EXISTED. A genesis cohort over the central Pacific (N 9) published
 * a Category 1 timing median of 72 h and a Category 3 median of 228 h -- each over ONE storm. A
 * Gulf genesis cohort (N 155) published a Category 3 median of 63 h over six. The Atlas's own
 * Forward Outcome View already refuses Category 5 timing at n 3, so the two surfaces disagreed
 * about the same archive.
 *
 * THE COUNT SURVIVES THE REFUSAL. Three storms reaching Category 5 is a real observation; the
 * median of three is not a distribution. So `n` is published, the quantiles are null, and
 * `refused` is set -- the same shape every other refusal on this surface takes.
 *
 * AND `n` 0 IS NOT THE SAME STATE, THOUGH IT REFUSES TOO. `refused` says only that no quantile
 * is published, which is true at zero as it is at three. But "no storm in this cohort came
 * ashore there" and "too few did to describe when" are different findings, and a surface that
 * rendered them identically would be reporting an absence as a sample-size problem. The
 * difference is legible in `n` itself, so a caller distinguishes on `n === 0` rather than on a
 * second flag -- see the deck's MED h cell.
 *
 * THE GATE ARRIVES AS AN ARGUMENT, as it does for `rateResult`, and reading the constant here
 * instead was a bug the parity harness caught within a minute. `get_analogs` in the Python takes
 * `min_sample` from ITS caller and passes it down, and two of the parity vectors exist precisely
 * to vary it -- "min_sample of one" and "min_sample raised above the pool". A hardcoded ten
 * agrees with the Python on every ordinary query and disagrees on exactly the queries written to
 * test the gate. The default is the archive's own value so no caller has to restate it.

/* ---- THE FIFTH RULE ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A VARIABLE USED TO DEFINE A COHORT CANNOT BE REPORTED AS AN OUTCOME OF THAT COHORT.
 *
 * The archive's own four rules protect against sampling error. This one protects against a
 * question that cannot be asked. Condition a cohort on "reached Cat 3" and then ask what
 * fraction reached Cat 3, and the answer is 100% with a tight Wilson interval: arithmetically
 * flawless, completely circular, and indistinguishable on screen from a finding.
 *
 * It is not a hazard the Atlas has today, which is exactly why it is being closed now. The
 * shell keeps the two query surfaces apart by hand -- ui/atlas.jsx passes months, season,
 * basins and provisional into getAnalogs and pointedly not intensity or landfall. That
 * separation is load-bearing and it stops working the moment one cohort spec drives both, which
 * is what Phase 3 builds. Enforcing it in the UI would mean the engine still computes a
 * circular number and merely declines to draw it; enforced here, the number does not exist.
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT CIRCULAR, precisely:
 *   - conditioning on minPeak=cat3 makes every threshold AT OR BELOW cat3 circular. cat4 and
 *     cat5 remain genuine outcomes WITHIN the conditioned cohort and are still reported.
 *   - conditioning on a landfall region makes that region's `any` contract circular. Its
 *     `hurricane` contract is a real outcome among storms that came ashore there -- unless the
 *     condition itself required hurricane intensity, which makes both circular.
 *   - other regions are untouched.
 *   - TIME-TO-EVENT IS NEVER CIRCULAR. If every storm in the cohort reached Cat 3, the rate is
 *     a tautology but WHEN they reached it is a real distribution. Suppressing it would discard
 *     the most useful thing a conditioned cohort has to say.
