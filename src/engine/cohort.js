/* The cohort spec: one object that fully determines a population, and the only query surface.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Until now the Atlas had two query surfaces that did not compose.
 * `filterStorms` decided what was DRAWN; `getAnalogs` decided what was SCORED. A reader could
 * not ask one question and get one answer -- the map and the statistics were answering
 * different ones, and the shell kept them from colliding by hand. This collapses them.
 *
 * The spec is the truth. Everything else derives from it: the drawn rows, the outcome cards, the
 * URL, the saved scenario, the export header, the baseline for a comparison. Two specs that mean
 * the same cohort must serialise identically, which is what `normalise` is for -- without it a
 * scenario URL would depend on the order someone happened to click.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF CONDITIONS IS THE STORM'S OWN LIFECYCLE
 *     GENESIS -> ENVIRONMENT -> TRAJECTORY -> INTENSITY -> LANDFALL -> OUTCOME
 * so composing a query walks the path a storm walks, and the question assembles itself as a
 * sentence rather than as a form.
 *
 * TWO ZONES, BECAUSE TWO KINDS OF CONDITION ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION
 *   GIVEN            -- at or before genesis: where, when, which basin, what environment.
 *                       Forms "what happens to storms that BEGIN like this?"
 *   GIVEN THAT ALSO  -- outcome-side: peak intensity, landfall region.
 *                       Forms "what did the storms that ENDED UP like this have in common?"
 * Both are legitimate. Conflating them is how circular reasoning enters, so the zone travels
 * with every condition and the outcome-side ones declare what they cost -- see `conditionsOf`.

 * survives, because they set it. An ACTIVE SYSTEM is the opposite gesture. The reader has not
 * asked to narrow anything; they have named a storm and asked what the archive says about
 * storms that formed where it formed. Carrying their previous conditions across that gesture is
 * how the most dangerous sentence on the surface gets written: a cohort still conditioned on
 * `landfall: mexico` from ten minutes ago, relabelled with a live storm's name, publishing a
 * Mexico landfall rate of 100% by construction and reading as a forecast for that storm.
 *

 * population than it names.

 * the storms -- it is the APERTURE of the question, the reader's own declaration of how tight
 * "near here" is, and the control they move most. 250 km and 500 km are two readings of the same
 * question, not two questions, and resetting it to a default on every launch would throw away
 * the one setting the reader is actively working. The caller passes it explicitly, so the policy
 * is visible at the call site rather than buried here.
 *
 * `includeProvisional` deliberately returns to its default of FALSE. A cohort assembled to say
