/* THE COHORT, IN ENGLISH. One formatter, five call sites, no second opinion.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The cohort spec was described in five places -- the question at the top
 * of the rail, the chip for each applied condition, the comparison's "the same cohort without
 * X", the answer panel's subtitle, and the citable spec line -- and each one built its own
 * string by comma-joining pre-baked fragments. That is not a style problem. Comma-joining
 * fragments that were written to stand alone produces sentences that are WRONG about the cohort
 * they describe, and this surface's entire claim is that the sentence and the population come
 * from one object. What it actually rendered:
 *
 *     Storms formed in the NA, that reached CAT 5, that made landfall in hawaii
 *     Storms in Jan, formed in the NA
 *     the same cohort without that reached CAT 3+
 *     baseline 13.0% [11.9-14.1%] · without that reached CAT 3+      (once per outcome card)
 *
 * A missing "that", a dangling participle, a raw filter key where a contract name belongs, a
 * region printed in the lowercase the database happens to store, and a preposition doing the
 * work of a conjunction. A reader who cannot parse the question cannot audit the answer.
 *
 * THE FIX IS STRUCTURAL, NOT EDITORIAL. A condition no longer carries one pre-joined fragment.
 * It carries the GRAMMATICAL PARTS it can contribute, and one assembler decides how they
 * combine:
 *
 *   adjective    qualifies the head noun          "North Atlantic", "named"
 *   genesis      a verb phrase after "that formed" "in August or September"
 *   trajectory   its own verb phrase              "later entered the Caribbean Sea"
 *   outcome      an outcome-side verb phrase      "reached Category 3"
 *   trailing     a scope note                     "including seasons not yet post-analysed"
 *   value        the bare value, for a chip       "August or September"
 *   noun         a noun phrase, for "without X"   "the genesis-month condition"
 *
 * Because the parts are typed, a combination nobody anticipated still composes: there is no
 * path that emits a dangling comma, an empty noun, or two prepositions in a row, because no
 * part is ever concatenated with a separator chosen by a different function.
 *
 * THE ZONE DISTINCTION IS CARRIED BY THE GRAMMAR ITSELF. An outcome-side condition following a
 * genesis condition reads "…, given that they also reached Category 3" -- the reader is told,
 * in the sentence, that the question changed from "what happens to storms that BEGIN like this"
 * to "what did the storms that ENDED UP like this have in common". With no genesis condition
 * there is nothing to be "also", so it is a plain relative clause. The distinction the builder
 * draws with a dashed rule is the same distinction the sentence draws with a subordinate
 * clause, which is the point: it should be legible without the rule.
 *
 * NO NUMBER, NO THRESHOLD AND NO CLAIM IS DECIDED HERE. This module names things the spec
 * already says. It reads no archive, computes no count, and applies no filter -- every label
 * below is a display name for a code the engine chose, and an unknown code falls through to the
 * code itself rather than to a guess.
