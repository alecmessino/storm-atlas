/* getAnalogs -- the browser's execution surface for scripts/genesis/retrieval/analogs.py.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A SECOND METHODOLOGY. The archive's Python is authoritative. This file is a
 * transliteration of it, function by function and in the same order, so that the Atlas can
 * answer a click on the ocean without shipping the question to a server that does not exist.
 * scripts/test-atlas-parity.mjs runs both against the same query matrix and fails the build
 * when they disagree, which is the only thing that makes a second execution surface safe.
 *
 * WHAT IS PORTED. All of it, as of Phase 3.1: the spatial / seasonal / temporal filter, the
 * environment similarity weighting, the distance weighting, the effective sample size, the
 * gaps, the historical pathway density -- and the conditioned rates, their Wilson intervals,
 * the weighted rates, the refusal branches and the time-to-event distributions. The rate half
 * lives in ./rates.js.
 *
 * Phase 1 returned UNSCOREABLE_REQUIRES_CANONICAL wherever a rate belonged, because an
 * approximate browser statistic is not a smaller version of the archive's answer; it is a
 * different answer wearing its clothes. That box is closed by proving the port at parity, not
 * by lowering the bar.
 *
 * THE FOUR RULES, restated from the Python because they constrain this file too:
 *   1. Rates are refused below min_sample. Counts are always returned.
 *   2. The sample is STORMS, not track points.
 *   3. Effective sample size is published beside every rate, and the gate is applied to the
 *      RAW distinct-storm count, never to the flattering ESS.
 *   4. An absent outcome is not a zero.
 * AND A FIFTH, THIS BUILD'S OWN: a variable used to define the cohort cannot be reported as an
 * outcome of it. Enforced in rates.js -- `conditionedOn` below is how a caller declares what it
 * narrowed on, and the circular rows then refuse instead of returning a tautological 100%.

   * RATE is a tautology, but WHEN those storms reached it is a real distribution and usually
   * the most useful thing such a cohort has to say. Only rates go circular; timings do not.
   *
   * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   * THE LANDFALL SERIES IS ONE VALUE PER STORM -- ITS FIRST -- AND IT USED TO BE PER TRANSIT.
   * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   *
   * The old loop appended one value per LANDFALL, so a storm that came ashore in a region five
   * times contributed five values. It matched the Python, which is why it survived review; it
   * did not match the row it was rendered on.
   *
   * WHY THAT WAS WRONG, AND IT IS TWO FAULTS RATHER THAN ONE.
   *
   *  1. IT PUT TWO DENOMINATORS ON ONE ROW. The `landfall` rate beside this timing counts
   *     DISTINCT STORMS -- `count` out of `n_storms`. So the evidence deck published, on a
   *     single row, "6 of 142 storms came ashore in Central America, 4.2%" and "median time to
   *     landfall 141 h, n 11". Two numbers called n, one row, no explanation, and the reader
   *     has no way to know they count different things.
   *
   *  2. IT BIASED THE MEDIAN LATE, with a mechanism rather than by accident. Repeat transits
   *     happen later in a storm's life, so pooling them drags the quantiles toward the tail.
   *     Measured across five cohorts and nineteen region rows, every median that moved under
   *     this change moved EARLIER: the archive-wide Caribbean median falls from 72 h to 47 h,
   *     and an MDR-genesis cohort's Caribbean median from 112 h to 73 h -- 40 hours, on 50
   *     storms reporting 138 transits.
   *
   * 44.4% of the storms in this archive that come ashore anywhere transit some region more than
   * once, so this was the majority case and not a corner.
   *
   * FIRST LANDFALL, not last and not all, because that is what every other timing here means:
   * `hours_to_ts` is the hours to a FIRST crossing. "How long until this cohort's storms came
   * ashore here" is the question the row asks, and a storm answers it once.
   *
   * WHAT WAS DROPPED, AND IT WAS REAL. "How long until a transit of this coast" is a different
   * and legitimate question, and at 2.50 transits per storm the Caribbean has genuine repeat
   * exposure to describe. It is not published here, because it is only meaningful beside a
   * transit COUNT this surface does not publish either, and because two medians for one region
   * one row apart is a reconciliation no reader can perform. If repeat exposure is wanted it
   * needs its own surface and its own stated denominator. */

   *
   * The deck publishes each region twice -- ANY landfall and one at 64 kt or more -- and both
   * rows used to read the same `landfall_${region}` series, because only one existed. So the
   * hurricane row showed the ANY-strength timing under a heading that said otherwise, and since
   * a storm takes longer to reach hurricane strength than to reach a coast, the number it showed
   * was systematically EARLY.
   *
   * Measured, archive-wide: the CONUS hurricane row published 82 h where its own storms' first
   * hurricane-strength landfall has a median of 133 h -- 51 hours early, over 292 storms. The
   * Caribbean row published 47 h against 81 h. And two rows published a median where their own
   * population refuses: archive-wide Hawaii showed 193 h on n 2, a Gulf-genesis Mexico row
   * showed 70 h on n 3.
