/* THE LEDGER: what this method got right, what it got wrong, and how anyone would know.
 *
 * Every other surface in the Atlas answers "what does the record say". This one answers the
 * question a reader asks immediately afterwards and that almost no analytical product will
 * answer about itself: IS ANY OF THIS ANY GOOD?
 *
 * The answer comes from a run the archive has been doing since before this browser surface
 * existed -- `backtest/harness.py` replays the record storm by storm with a zero-peek `as_of`,
 * asks the analog engine for a probability at each moment, and scores what actually happened.
 * 1,039 storms, a 10,390-row ledger, Brier against climatology, reliability curves. Nothing
 * here computes a score; this module carries the archive's own scores to the screen and joins
 * them to the refusals they belong beside.
 *
 * THE JOIN IS THE POINT. A refusal that says "BASE RATE ONLY -- 2 events archive-wide" is a
 * claim about the record. The ledger is the evidence for or against that claim, and putting
 * them in one place is what turns a refusal from a policy into a finding.
 *
 * AND IT DID NOT FLATTER. The join showed that the refusal gate counted the wrong population:
 * it asked whether the WHOLE ARCHIVE carried ten events, when what decides skill is whether the
 * population a query can draw from carries them. Of the four contracts that earned no skill
 * claim, the archive-wide gate caught one.
 *
 * METHODOLOGY 1.1.0 CLOSED IT, AND THE LEDGER STILL SHOWS IT. The gate now counts in scope and
 * catches four of four. Both verdicts stay on every contract -- `verdict_archive_wide` beside
 * `verdict` -- because a ledger that stopped reporting the defect the moment it was fixed would
 * be a ledger with no record of ever having caught anything, and the next reader has no way to
 * tell that apart from one that never looks.
