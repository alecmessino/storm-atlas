/* THE OPERATIONAL LAYER, AND THE WALL AROUND IT.
 *
 * The Atlas's packs are IBTrACS. IBTrACS's current-season record is PROVISIONAL: it is published
 * early, it stops being updated long before the storm stops existing, and it is not post-analysed.
 * For CP012026 / LALA the shipped pack holds 49 fixes, 65 kt, 988 mb, ending 2026-08-16T00:00Z,
 * while the storm was still being written up nine days later at 115 kt peak and 947 mb minimum.
 * The Atlas was rendering the stub as though it were the storm's life.
 *
 * This module reads a separate artifact -- atlas-live-v1.json, written by the pipeline's own
 * ingest from the ATCF b-deck -- and turns it into the OPERATIONAL representation of a selected
 * current storm.
 *
 * ================= WHAT THIS MODULE IS NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH =================
 *
 * Nothing in here may reach the archive. Not the cohort, not analog matching, not intensity or
 * landfall rates, not a Wilson interval, not ESS, not calibration, not reliability, not the
 * archive comparison, not an event gate, not a refusal, not zero-peek replay. Those are
 * historical research over a post-analysed record, and an operational value entering any of them
 * would silently change what the archive says while looking like a bug fix.
 *
 * The wall is STRUCTURAL rather than a rule someone has to remember:
 *
 *   1. `Live` never sees the Archive's mutable state and the Archive never sees `Live`. The join
 *      is done by the caller, by ATCF id, and produces a THIRD object that neither owns.
 *   2. No historical module imports this file. scripts/test-atlas-live-boundary.mjs reads the
 *      import graph and fails the build if one ever does.
 *   3. Every historical entry point still takes exactly the arguments it took before. There is no
 *      optional `live` parameter anywhere in cohort.js, analogs.js, rates.js, stats.js,
 *      calibration.js, compare.js or timeline.js, so there is no call site that could pass one.
 *
 * ================= PRECEDENCE, IN ONE PARAGRAPH =================
 *
 * For a storm whose ARCHIVE record is provisional and for which an operational record exists, the
 * operational record IS the selected-storm representation: its fixes, its peak, its minimum, its
 * latest position and stage. The two are never concatenated and never blended -- taking the union
 * of two best tracks that overlap for six days would duplicate every fix in the overlap and
 * average two answers to the same question. The archive record stays exactly where it is,
 * unmodified, and remains the only thing the research surfaces read. When the archive record
 * stops being provisional -- post-analysis -- the archive wins and the operational record is no
 * longer used for values. That transition needs no code: it follows from the `provisional` column.

/* WHY IT IS READ FROM the forecast payload RATHER THAN EMITTED INTO atlas-live-v1.json.
 *
 * The pipeline already fetches and parses NHC's forecast: docs/data/latest.json carries
 * `storms[].trackPoints` — valid time, position, wind, gust — per active system. Copying nine
 * points into the Atlas's own artifact would pay for the same bytes twice AND put a second copy
 * on a different refresh cadence from the first, so two surfaces could disagree about the
 * current advisory while both were "fresh".
 *
 * AND IT IS OUTSIDE THE ATLAS'S BYTE GATE. `bench-atlas.mjs` sweeps every .gz and .json in
 * docs/storm-atlas/data/; latest.json is not in it. Measured: 1,088,528 B raw, 80,726 B gzipped
 * as GitHub Pages serves it — 5.8% of what the pack already pulls on its critical path, and
 * fetched only when a reader asks for the forward view, never on first paint.
 *
 * FAIL OPEN. A forward view without a forecast is still a forward view of the archive; a
 * forecast that will not load must degrade to "no official forecast loaded", never to a stub
 * that looks like one. */
/* WHERE THE OFFICIAL FORECAST ACTUALLY SHIPS, and it is not in this artifact's data directory.
 *
 * `latest.json` is the forecast payload. It lives at `docs/data/latest.json` -- a sibling of
 * `docs/storm-atlas/`, not a file inside it -- and reading it rather than minting an Atlas copy
 * is the whole point: the forward view adds no byte to the packs the transfer gate sweeps.
 *
 * The path is relative to the Atlas's own DATA BASE (`data`, beside index.html), so it climbs
 * twice: out of `data/` and out of `storm-atlas/`. An earlier draft wrote `../data/latest.json`,
 * which climbs once and resolves to `storm-atlas/data/latest.json` -- a file that does not exist,
 * a fetch that 404s, and a surface that would have reported "the forecast payload could not be
 * read" forever while looking entirely correct in review. scripts/test-atlas-forward.mjs now
 * resolves this string against the shell's base and asserts the file is on disk. */

 *  2. NO ATCF ID, NO JOIN. Most of this archive predates ATCF ids. A storm without one cannot be
 *     matched to an operational record and is not expected to have one.
 *  3. SEASON MUST AGREE. A defensive check that costs one comparison and forecloses the entire
 *     class of wrong-storm joins.
 *  4. THE LIVE LAYER FAILED TO LOAD. Now the fail-closed rule bites: the archive record is
 *     PROVISIONAL, so it is known to be incomplete, and there is no way to tell how incomplete.
 *     Showing it as a finished storm is the failure this whole change exists to end, so the state
 *     is `unavailable` and the panel says so.
 *  5. THE LAYER LOADED AND SAYS THIS STORM SHOULD HAVE A RECORD, but does not carry one. Same
 *     answer, better reason: the artifact's own health block names it as missing.
 *  6. THE LAYER LOADED AND HAS THE RECORD. Operational.
 *  7. THE LAYER LOADED AND DOES NOT EXPECT ONE. A provisional storm from a season nobody is
 *     tracking any more. The archive stub is all there is, it is still marked PROVISIONAL exactly
 *     as it was before this change, and nothing claims an operational continuation exists.

/* ---- the lifecycle of an operational record -------------------------------------------
 *
 * WHY THIS IS DERIVED HERE AND NOT LEFT TO THE ARCHIVE'S COLUMNS.
 *
 * The archive's genesis_events table carries hours_to_ts / cat1 / cat3 and the pack derives
 * cat2 / cat4 / cat5. Those describe the PROVISIONAL ARCHIVE RECORD. Printed beside an
 * operational peak they produce a flat contradiction on screen: for CP012026 the archive says
 * `CATEGORY 3 · 96 kt — never reached`, and the panel three rows above it says the storm reached
 * 115 kt. A dash there means "never reached the threshold", and against the operational record
 * that statement is false.
 *
 * So the ladder is re-derived from the operational fixes, by THE ARCHIVE'S OWN RULE, transcribed
 * from scripts/genesis/build/build_atlas_pack.py:derive_crossings and
 * build/genesis_events.py:build_genesis_events:
 *
 *   * genesis is the FIRST TROPICAL fix, by the archive's own status vocabulary;
 *   * only fixes at or after genesis are eligible;
 *   * the crossing is the FIRST fix at or above the threshold, never the maximum;
 *   * a threshold never reached has no crossing and no elapsed hours -- it is absent, not zero.
 *
 * The one rule that has no operational counterpart is the observed-versus-interpolated pool. A
 * b-deck has no interpolated fixes: every row is the forecast office's own analysis. The pool is
 * therefore every fix, and that is a difference in the SOURCE, not a relaxation of the rule.
 *
 * Everything this returns is DERIVED and the panel marks it so. It is a statement about one
 * selected storm and it goes nowhere near a cohort. */
